* Create your second model and add the folling routes and tests

## Server Endpoints
### `/api/resource-name`
* `POST` request
 * pass data as stringified json in the body of a post request to create a resource

### `/api/resource-name/:id`
* `GET` request
 * pass the id of a resource though the query string to fetch a resource   
* `PUT` request
 * pass data as stringified json in the body of a put request to update a resource
* `DELETE` request
 * pass the id of a resource though the query string to delete a resource   

## Tests
* your tests should start your server when they begin and stop your server when they finish
